## Ruby on Rails Routes

###### RESTful

* Use `resources` to use RESTful routes

* Avoid the :except option in routes.

* Use resources nesting with :member and :collection routes

* Order resourceful routes alphabetically by name.

* Use the :only option to explicitly state exposed routes.

* Use parameters into routes

* Define root route

# Ruby on Rails Factories (FactoryGirl)

* Don't use direct association in FactoryGirl.
* Use traits to modular factories and associations
* Prefer create structure of database on test to make the visualization more clear.

__Warning! FactoryGirl is a highway to hell if not follow this three simple rules!__

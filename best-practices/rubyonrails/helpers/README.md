# Ruby on Rails Helpers

* Use helper to keep views clean and build a single unit piece of display, like a span, link, text_boxes, etc
* Use helpers to translation some attrs, models, etc more easily.
* Use helpers to create custom formatations for views, like time, money, etc.
* Don't use helpers when you need large pieces of html code. Use partials instead of.
* Consider to use [Presenters](http://nithinbekal.com/posts/rails-presenters/).

###### Open/Closed Principle

- The classes or methods should be open for extension and closed for changes, that is, if a behavior / rule need to change, should be to create new code, rather than change the existing code.
- A new behavior should be added without change the old code.
- Class should be more abstract to facilitate maintenance

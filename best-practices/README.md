# Best Practices

A guide for programming well.

## General

* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask when in doubt.
* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* [Exceptions should be exceptional](http://www.readability.com/~/yichhgvu).
* [Keep the code simple](http://www.readability.com/~/ko2aqda2).
